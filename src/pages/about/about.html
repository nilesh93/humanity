            <p> Humanity is a 2017 free service to assist charities and non profits in fundraising. Our aim is to provide money and build awareness for both charities and fundraisers to help raise much needed funds. Hundreds of advertisement companies publish
                their ads in Humanity and the users can view them to increase points. They can donate these collected points to the causes.
                <br> Our mission is to ensure no great cause goes unfunded.
